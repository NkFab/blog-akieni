# blog-akieni Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the **blog-akieni** project locally and preparing it for production.

## 1. Clone the Project

Clone the repository from GitHub `git@github.com:NkFab/blog-akieni.git` .

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NkFab/blog-akieni.git
cd blog-akieni
```

## 2. Install the Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager. The project likely includes a `package.json` file with defined dependencies. Check for a lock file (`package-lock.json` for npm, `yarn.lock` for Yarn, or `pnpm-lock.yaml` for pnpm) to determine the recommended package manager.

### Using npm
```bash
npm install
```

### Using Yarn
```bash
yarn install
```

### Using pnpm
```bash
pnpm install
```

## 3. Start the Development Server

Start the development server to run the project locally.

### Using npm
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Using Yarn
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Using pnpm
```bash
pnpm dev
```

This typically launches the app on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified). Check the terminal output for the exact URL.

## 4. Request for Environment Variables

Many projects require environment variables for configuration (e.g., API keys, database URLs). Look for a `.env.example` or `.env.sample` file in the repository, which lists required variables. If it exists:

Copy it to create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with the necessary values.

If there’s no example file or documentation, request the environment variables from the project maintainers (e.g., **"manzi"**). Without these, features like API integration or database access might not work.

## 5. Build for Production

To create a production-ready build, most projects define a `build` script in `package.json`. Run the appropriate command for your package manager:

### Using npm
```bash
npm run build
```

### Using Yarn
```bash
yarn build
```

### Using pnpm
```bash
pnpm build
```

This typically generates a `dist`, `build`, or similar folder with optimized assets ready for deployment.

## 6. Live Demo Link

## Additional Notes

- **Scripts in `package.json`**: The exact script names (`dev`, `build`, etc.) might vary. Check the `scripts` section in `package.json` to confirm the correct commands.
- **Environment Variables**: If the `.env` setup is unclear or variables are missing, functionality might break—reach out to the project owner for clarification.
- **Package Manager Choice**: If the project includes a lock file for one package manager, it’s best to stick with that to avoid dependency conflicts.
